# Contributing to Open Topo Data

Thanks for improving Open Topo Data!

* Open Topo Data is largely feature-complete. Development is mostly bug fixes and minor internal improvements. New features that add complexity or modify the API are less likely to happen, but feature requests are always welcome!
* Please open an issue for a new feature rather than jumping straight to a pull request. That way, we can discuss the design and if it's a feature that ought to be added at all.
* A pull request should contain isolated changes pertaining to a single bug fix or feature implementation.
* New code should be 100% covered by tests.
* Submit PRs to the `dev` branch.
* Code written by LLMs should be disclosed as such, for example in the PR description.
